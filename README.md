# DABNet: Depth-wise Asymmetric Bottleneck for Real-time Semantic Segmentation
This project contains the Pytorch implementation for the proposed DABNet: [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11357).

Please refer to this repository to obtain all the files as I have uploaded only the main model. The repository is: https://github.com/Reagan1311/DABNet
